# Python-AI
A project in AI intelligence working with multiple models and using ML, deep learning, and neural networks using python and libraries like Keras, TensorFlow, sklearn in this project I was able to compete in a Kaggle obtaining the 2021 rank in the global leaderboard in one of the projects, I was also able to explore multiple concepts as the difference between artificial intelligence, computational intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks also some of the paradigms we encounter when working in the AI field, understanding implementations such as REAS and PAME . Some of the important topics and models in this project were the classification of intelligence agents, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, linear regression,data augmentation, image clasification, optimizers, regularizers, batch normalization, CNN architecture, clustering, k-means, and random forest. Some of the metrics and errors to take into account to measure overfitting, underfitting, and errors in the metrics we focus on are mean squared error (mse), mean absolute error (mae),  root mean squared error (rmse), confusion matrix, precision.
